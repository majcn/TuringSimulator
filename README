This is a simple turing machine simulator written in python.

The turing file sytax should be
init: initialState
final: list of all final states
state char_1 ... char_n -> new_char_1 ... new_char_n move_1 .. move_n

allowed moves are R - right, L - left, S - stop. Reserved symbol on the tape is B for blank.

run the turing simulator with ./turingD.py inputWord

and some extra options:

  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -t, --trace         Set for trace turing machine
  -r, --result        Print the output from the first track
  -b, --clearBlanks   Clear unused blanks from tracks
  -f F, --fileName=F  Filename for turing machine

have fun :)
